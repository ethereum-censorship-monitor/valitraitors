    Ethereum is neutral and permissionless infrastructure. We recruited validators to produce blocks
    and fill them with our transactions. However, some of them decide to censor particular
    transactions. We therefore call them valitraitors. This website looks for evidence of this
    behavior and makes it available for everyone to see.
