    The core promise of Ethereum is to be neutral and permissionless infrastructure. To live up to
    this dream, it relies on the validators it recruited to treat all transactions equally when
    building blocks. However, recently some validators have been censoring certain transactions.
    This violates one of the core tenets of our community. We therefore call them valitraitors. Our
    website looks for evidence of such unacceptable behavior and makes it available for everyone to
    see.
